I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of monetary and financial economics, with a focus on banking, systemic risk, network modeling, and the conduct of monetary policy.

I hold a BSc in Economics from the University of Warwick and an MSc in Economics (specializing in Data Science) from Tilburg University.
